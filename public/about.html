<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!, My name is Kea and I am an Electrical and computer engineer and university of cape town. And its been my dream to
  be able to make electronical devices that can be useful to the world and also being able to create web technology that goes along with them.
  I came from a small village in Zeerust called Borakalalo where I graduated high school at.
</p>

<p>Am currently focused on becoming a fully fledged website developer. I believe having this skill can open up paths for me that leads towards destinations that align with my ambitions
  I enjoy learning more about web developing as it is a constantly changing field of work and being able to match the pace of change by learning for me is quite an experience.
